/**
 * Command transport for an optional owner-thread backend. Not the default - production calls go
 * through {@link PdfiumRuntime} directly - and it exists only for experiments, so no two calls ever overlap by construction. Deliberately not a specialized queue, since a command carries a whole document operation and transport cost is off the hot path. Contract: bounded FIFO admission (a full queue rejects rather than running on the caller, which would break PDFium's single-thread rule); accepted commands run to completion even if quiesce happens while queued (admission is checked once at submission); a command submitted from the owner runs inline to avoid self-deadlock; and interruption does not abandon the command - the caller waits for the real outcome then restores its interrupt status, since native code may still borrow the caller's buffers.
