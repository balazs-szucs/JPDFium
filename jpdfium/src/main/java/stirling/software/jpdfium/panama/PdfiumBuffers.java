/**
 * Ownership policy for pixel buffers exchanged with the PDFium domain. A confined FFM arena belongs
 * to its creating thread, so a caller-confined target bitmap can never be handed to a future owner-thread dispatcher; the policy is explicit: synchronous {@code renderInto} is a legacy caller-thread operation that accepts any valid native segment and uses it inline (before an owner-thread backend becomes default it must require shared caller storage, copy into owner-owned storage, or be deprecated - never smuggle a raw confined address across threads); any buffer whose native use outlives the call (progressive sessions, retained targets) must be a {@link SharedRenderBuffer} held through an explicit {@link RenderLease}, with the native arena closing only after every lease is released; and library-owned results ({@code renderAt}, detached saves) are always safe to process concurrently because the pixels are a plain detached allocation with no PDFium identity.
