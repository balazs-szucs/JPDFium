# For the natives jar to load in minimal containers / chroots (Debian LXC,
# Proxmox, Nix sandboxes) the bundled libraries must not depend on system
# packages that aren't present there: every NEEDED dependency must be bundled
# next to the bridge OR be a core system lib (libc/libm/ld-linux/...) that every
# Linux runtime ships.
#
# A library that needs, say, system libqpdf.so but doesn't bundle it would load
# fine on a fat CI runner and fail with "cannot open shared object file" inside
# an LXC container. This check makes that class of bug fail the build instead.
